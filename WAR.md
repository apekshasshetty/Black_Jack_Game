### WAR GAME
We will use Python OOP to simulate a simplified version of the game war. Two players will each start off with half the deck, then they each remove a card, compare which card has the highest value, and the player with the higher card wins both cards. 

### Single Card Class
Creating a Card Class with outside variables
Here we will use some outside variables that we know don't change regardless of the situation, such as a deck of cards. Regardless of what round,match, or game we're playing, we'll still need the same deck of cards.

### Player Class

Let's create a Player Class, a player should be able to hold instances of Cards, they should also be able to remove and add them from their hand. We want the Player class to be flexible enough to add one card, or many cards so we'll use a simple if check to keep it all in the same method.
